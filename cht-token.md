More details coming soon.



## Buyback and burn.

A portion of the reserve fund will be used to execute buyback and burn operations. However, the buybacks are meant to maximize the amount of tokens burnt, and will only be executed during periods of downturn. Chateau will not buyback CHT indiscriminately. The buybacks will be executed during periods of downtrends.
