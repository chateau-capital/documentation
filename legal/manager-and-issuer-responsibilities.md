# Manager and Issuer Responsibilities

**Chateau Capital Corp – Platform Framework**

Chateau Capital Corp ("Chateau"), a Panamanian corporation, enables firms and qualified individuals globally to issue tokenized representations of real-world assets (“RWAs”) on-chain in a secure and cost-efficient manner. In select cases, Chateau itself may serve as the manager for certain offerings conducted through the platform.

***

**1. Role of the Manager**\
The **Manager** refers to the ultimate beneficial owner (UBO) or designated entity responsible for overseeing an asset offering conducted via the Chateau platform. In all cases, the Manager is legally accountable to token holders and exercises operational control over the issuance smart contract via a designated wallet address.

Managerial functions may include:

* Structuring the offering via an SPV or comparable legal entity
* Authorizing token issuance, redemptions, and distributions
* Interfacing with investors throughout the lifecycle of the token
* Coordinating recoveries in the event of default or impairment
* Assuming liability in the event of regulatory, legal, or operational breaches

Participation as a Listing Manager on Chateau is subject to rigorous KYC/AML vetting and institutional-grade due diligence. Only a select subset of applicants who meet Chateau’s compliance and risk standards are approved.

**2. Role of the Issuer**\
The **Issuer** is typically the deal sponsor or originating party who structures the underlying asset and facilitates its tokenization. The Issuer is responsible for establishing the legal framework for the asset (typically via a Special Purpose Vehicle or trust structure), and ensuring the legal link between off-chain assets and their on-chain tokenized representations.

Issuer responsibilities include:

* Custody and safekeeping of the underlying RWA
* Interfacing between the SPV and smart contract infrastructure
* Administering dividends, interest, or distributions (as applicable)
* Managing redemption processes according to the offering terms
* Executing and reporting on recoveries in the event of default
* Complying with ongoing disclosure and reporting obligations
* Serving as the primary respondent in any legal or regulatory action

***

**3. Nature of ch.asset Tokens**\
ch.asset tokens represent pro-rata, on-chain claims to the underlying real-world asset held within the Issuer’s SPV. Depending on the specific offering structure, these claims may constitute:

* Debt obligations
* Equity interests
* Participation notes
* Other asset-linked financial instruments

Each issuance is governed by a bespoke set of offering documents, outlining the legal, economic, and operational terms of the asset and associated token.

***

**4. Legal Accountability**\
All Managers and Issuers are independently liable for the financial and operational conduct of their respective deals. Chateau Capital Corp provides the underlying technology platform and administrative tools to facilitate tokenization, but assumes no fiduciary responsibility for asset performance or investor outcomes. Each token holder is advised to conduct independent due diligence prior to participation.
