# What is private credit?

**Private credit** or Alternative Debt refers to debt investments that are made directly into private companies — typically outside of traditional banking channels or public bond markets. Unlike public credit (e.g. corporate bonds), private credit is negotiated bilaterally, structured with flexible terms, and often collateralized with cash flow, assets, or business receivables.

Private credit is used by businesses that are too large for microloans but too small or non-standard for bank lending. It plays a vital role in funding growth, acquisition, working capital, and refinancing — often at higher yields than traditional fixed income.

### These can include:

* Mezzanine debt
* Distressed debt
* Private credit
* Structured credit from non-bank lenders or investment funds
