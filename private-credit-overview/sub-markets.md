### 🧾 Consumer Lending Market

The consumer lending segment involves individuals borrowing from banks and non-bank lenders. These loans typically fund personal expenses and are underwritten based on credit scores and income data.

**Key structures:**

* **Unsecured Consumer Credit**\
  Credit cards, personal loans, and buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) products. These are not backed by collateral and rely entirely on the borrower’s credit profile.
* **Secured Consumer Credit**\
  Mortgages, auto loans, and other forms of personal credit backed by specific assets. Lenders underwrite both the borrower's profile and the asset value.

### 🏢 Corporate Lending Market

This segment involves companies raising debt capital from non-bank lenders and private investors. These are generally bespoke, higher-yielding credit agreements for growing or underbanked firms.

**Key structures:**

* **Venture Debt**\
  Loans extended to VC-backed startups, often with equity kickers or warrants. These are typically offered by venture debt funds.
* **Middle Market Loans**\
  Target companies with $10–75 million in EBITDA. These loans may be secured or unsecured and are often held by private credit funds with flexible terms.

### 🏦 Commercial Loan Market

Commercial loans are usually originated by banks and extended to companies with operating history and existing cash flow. These loans are more standardized but vary in collateralization.

**Key structures:**

* **Unsecured Loans**\
  Backed by cash flow and corporate guarantees, but no specific collateral.
* **Asset-Based Loans (ABLs)**\
  Secured by tangible or financial assets such as inventory, receivables, or equipment. These loans often come with borrowing base formulas.

### 🇺🇸 U.S. Private Placement Market

The U.S. Private Placement (USPP) market involves investment-grade companies raising long-term debt from insurance companies and other large institutions. These deals are typically less liquid but highly structured.

**Key structures:**

* **Unsecured Private Placements**\
  Long-term notes issued without collateral, supported by strong financials and credit ratings.
* **Secured Private Placements**\
  Asset-backed private notes structured for risk-averse institutional buyers.

### 🔧 Structured Credit Market

Structured credit involves bundling income-generating assets (like loans or leases) into a vehicle that issues debt backed by the cash flows of those assets.

**Key structures:**

* **Credit Facilities**\
  Debt extended by a single bank or fund to a special purpose vehicle (SPV), secured by the pool of contributed assets.
* **Private Securitizations**\
  Asset-backed debt issued to a group of private investors. These are often tranched and involve credit enhancements or external servicing.
