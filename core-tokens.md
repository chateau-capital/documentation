# Core Tokens

## chUSD

chUSD is Chateau's flagship synthetic dollar, minted when users deposit USDC and USDT. chUSD can be redeemed for USDC, but receives no yield.

## schUSD

Users that stake their chUSD receive schUSD, with yield that is generated from Private Credit strategies deployed by Covenant VC, Chateau's hedge fund partner. chUSD is an ERC-4626 tokenized vault that accrues chUSD over time. To convert schUSD back to chUSD, users can unstake their schUSD, but this takes three weeks, during which no additional yield is earned.

## ch.Assets

chAssets wrap Real World Assets in a tokenized SPV. (Coming soon)

## CHT

CHT is the governance token for Chateau. CHT is periodically bought back and burnt from Chateau's profits through the BTFD fund.
