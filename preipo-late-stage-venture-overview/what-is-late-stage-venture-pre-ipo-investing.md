# 🚀 What Is Late-Stage Venture / Pre-IPO Investing?

**Late-stage venture** (sometimes referred to as **pre-IPO investing**) refers to investing in private companies that are past the early growth phase and approaching a potential **exit event**, such as an initial public offering (IPO), acquisition, or secondary sale.

These companies typically have:

* Proven business models
* Strong revenue growth (often $100M+)
* Institutional cap tables (Tier-1 VCs, strategics)
* A clear path to liquidity

At this stage, the risk of failure is lower than in early-stage venture, but the **valuation has already appreciated significantly**. Investors are betting not on survival, but on **scaling, defensibility, and premium exit multiples.**

#### 🧠 Why Pre-IPO Access Is Valuable

Historically, access to late-stage equity rounds has been limited to:

* Large VC firms
* Corporate investors
* High-net-worth insiders with privileged relationships

However, with the rise of **secondary markets** (e.g. EquityZen, Zanbato) and **structured investment vehicles** (like Chateau’s tokenized SPVs), broader investor access is becoming possible — even in tightly held names.

Pre-IPO investing offers:

* **Exposure to marquee tech companies** before public market hype
* **Valuation arbitrage** if public comps are priced higher
* **Less dilution and risk** compared to seed-stage startups

#### 🧪 Example: Anduril Industries

Consider **Anduril**, a defense-tech company founded by Oculus creator Palmer Luckey. The company:

* Has raised billions from a16z, Founders Fund, General Catalyst, and others
* Is a key player in autonomous defense systems for the U.S. and allies
* Remains private — but active in secondary markets at \~$9B valuation

Through structured vehicles like **ch.ADRL**, investors can gain **tokenized exposure** to equity in companies like Anduril, with smart contract–based issuance, offshore compliance, and investor-aligned terms.

#### 🔍 Key Considerations

Pre-IPO investing is compelling, but comes with nuances:

* Liquidity may be delayed (no public market yet)
* Pricing can vary across secondary sellers
* Due diligence is critical (cap table, rights, lockups)

That’s why platforms like Chateau work with **verified brokers, legal wrappers, and smart contracts** to ensure investors receive clean, auditable exposure to institutional-grade pre-IPO opportunities.
