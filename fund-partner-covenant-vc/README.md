# Fund Partner: Covenant VC

Chateau has partnered with Covenant Venture Capital ([www.covenantvc.com](https://www.covenantvc.com)) to bring yields to chUSD. Chateau maintains an exclusive partnership with Covenant, leveraging their experience across multiple asset classes to power our DeFi products. In particular, Covenant VC Credit Income Opportunities Fund has consistently delivered 2+ Sharpe returns that beat the market.

The Sharpe ratio is a metric used to assess how well an investment's returns compensate for the risk taken. It's calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the investment's return and dividing the result by the investment's standard deviation, which measures volatility. A higher Sharpe ratio generally indicates a better risk-adjusted return. [Learn more about the Sharpe Ratio here.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp)
