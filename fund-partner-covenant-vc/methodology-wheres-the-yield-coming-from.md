description: Yield Generation with high Sharpe

# Methodology: Where's the yield coming from?

While elevated yields in decentralized finance frequently invite skepticism, the returns generated by schUSD are grounded in institutional processes rather than extractive tokenomics.

Alpha is derived from lending, risk management, and due diligence activities executed by Covenant VC, an SEC-regulated and professionally audited investment manager. The Covenant VC team applies rigorous, data-driven methodologies and time-tested portfolio management practices to optimize returns while actively mitigating downside risk.\


## A track record of outperformance since 2011

#### Covenant VC Track Record

The Covenant VC team participates in a $500 million institutional loan syndicate that has consistently generated strong deal flow and robust returns‚Äîranging from 18.65% during the market stress of the COVID-19 pandemic to 21.7% across the 2011‚Äì2022 period.

For Chateau Protocol‚Äôs portfolio, Covenant selectively deploys capital into this pipeline, applying a systematic approach designed to maximize risk-adjusted returns:

1. Identifying loans with mispriced risk,
2. Maintaining a hyper-diversified portfolio, and
3. Executing rigorous risk mitigation practices.

Applying this methodology, Chateau‚Äôs portfolio delivered a 33% return in 2024 with a high Sharpe ratio profile.

scUSD's exceptional returns are driven by 3 main factors:

### 1. Mispriced Risk

* ÔªøÔªøSmall business loans in the loan syndicate schUSD sources from average 36% gross return, and have a historical default rate ranging from 5% to 8% from 2011 - 2022. Yield/Default = 4.5x (higher is better)
* ÔªøÔªøBy comparison, credit card portfolios currently average about 23% gross return with a historical default rate ranging from 1.5% to 6.8%. Current Yield/Default 7.6x
* ÔªøÔªøSimilarly, sub-prime auto portfolios have average return of 16% with default rates ranging from 2.8%\
  to 6.05%. Current Yield/Default = 2.64
* ÔªøRisk is measured in terms of interest rates. Higher interest rates are the investor's reward for bearing a higher risk.
* ÔªøÔªøMispriced Risk is a concept where the correlation between risk (default events) and interest rate diverge to the benefit of the lender. An example would be a bond that pays a high yield such as a junk bond yield, while having a AAA investment grade rating.
* However, Market perception is that small company loans are riskier than larger company loans
* Leverage is 4X more relevant to predicting loan default than company size according to Moody's

### 2. Hyper Diversification

In the illustrative graph below depicting the trajectories of individual portfolio positions, an n=10 positions is insufficient to understand overall portfolio behavior. In contrast, with hyper-diversification we target an n=100+ which increases reliability

E is the overall portfolio expected return while X is the distribution from which each individual portfolio position is sampled from, namely, xi . In this way we track our portfolios both on a micro and macro level.\

### 3. Risk Mitigation

### Risk Management

Covenant employs comprehensive risk management strategies that deliver high sharpe returns

1. **Maximum Concentration:** \
   No loan can be more than 10% of the fund or 1% of a side account. Each portfolio\
   is comprised of a minimum of 50 loans participations.&#x20;
2. **Security** \
   UCC 1 filings on all company cash flow, accounts receivable, and unencumbered assets.&#x20;
3. **Personal guarantees** \
   80% of loans are backed by personal guarantees of the owner. Guarantors must have minimum 650 credit score.&#x20;
4. **Minority participant:** \
   Covenant never invests more than 20% of the principal of a loan.\


### üîê Risk Mitigation in Credit Investing

Covenant VC follows a multi-phase process to underwrite, structure, and monitor credit investments. This framework is designed to reduce default risk, ensure accurate documentation, and maintain strong financial controls throughout the lifecycle of each loan.
