# USDtb

USDtb is a digital dollar, otherwise known as a USD stablecoin. USDtb can be used the same way a holder would use any other dollar, whether to send and receive payments, acquire and trade assets, or to simply hold dollars.

Unlike actual dollars, USDtb is a blockchain-based token, which enables faster and cheaper spending than the traditional fiat banking system. Unlike many digital assets, USDtb is fully backed by institutional-grade tokenized U.S. treasury fund products (alongside a stablecoin reserve designed to facilitate rapid redemptions) to support stability. Initially, USDtb will be backed by BlackRockâ€™s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund Token, BUIDL.
