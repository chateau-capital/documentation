# Minting and Redemption

chUSD may be minted and redeemed by qualified counterparties.

#### Collateral Safeguards

To ensure the integrity of collateral, the majority of chUSD backing is custodied with Chateau Protocolâ€™s regulated custodian partner. Real-time collateral tracking is available via API, providing transparency and oversight into system reserves.\

The transfer of collateral between custodian wallets to minting and redemption smart contract wallets is processed manually, and may take several hours. \
\
Redemptions are processed in a queue on a first come first served basis.

#### **Security and Risk Controls**

**Transaction Limits**\
As a protective measure, chUSD mints and redemptions are capped at $100,000 per block. Continuous transaction monitoring ensures that chUSD remains fully collateralized at all times.

**Emergency Controls**\
Designated _Gatekeeper\_role_ monitors retain the authority to freeze the chUSD contract in the event of malicious activity or a security breach, thereby minimizing potential losses.

**Sanctions Compliance**\
Chateau Protocol enforces strict compliance with U.S. sanctions. Mint and redemption addresses are screened against the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) lists via ofac-api.com, and blacklisted addresses are prohibited from accessing Chateau Protocol.
